remember that envoy is there for subprocess stuff.

restart steps: 
 - get the master API server running with some RSS feeds to test with
   - make sure that logging is happening in the right place.
   - server should query the DB on startup as to what feeds it knows about
   - should add everything via API calls.
 - get the fetcher working for those RSS feeds
 - make sure that we can run multiple instances of the fetcher
 - work out all of the DB storage format wrinkles that are sure to come up
 - work on post history and pre-digestion code
 - get login working at reasonably secure
   - generate a local SSL cert to test with before I buy one.
 - get non-ajax UI working
 - start making thing ajaxy
 - start asking around for testers
 - friend/comment/follow UI stuff

site:
 - finish test harness
 - rework authentication to not suck so horribly
 - need to be able to change passwords & personal details
 - improve the browsing UI
 - implement the commenting UI
 - implement relationships and sharing
 - then we bang on the UI for signing up and authentication

fetch: 
 - rebalance feeds somehow.
 - feed check is heartbeat
 - dead/stuck fetcher detection


API:
 
 - finish API 

meta:
 - make sure to write a manifest of how you setup the venv 
 - write shell script to do apt & venv on new ubuntu image
 - figure out how to backup a mongodb instance.
 - figure out how to mirror a mongodb instance.

 - then we get a cheap SSL key
 - recruit some beta testers

done:
+ order local server
+ should be possible to init a new VM instance with a few commands
+ rework everything http to use requests
