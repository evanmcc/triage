- first thing is to get all the parts working locally (api calling over sockets not exposed to the internet), along with the roughest possible web front end.
  - make sure to write a manifest of how you setup the venv 
  - write shell script to do apt & venv on new ubuntu image

- finish API 
- finish test harness
- rework authentication to not suck so horribly
- need to be able to change passwords & personal details

- figure out how to backup a mongodb instance.
- figure out how to mirror a mongodb instance.

- then we get a cheap SSL key
- then we bang on the UI for signing up and authentication
- improve the browsing UI
- implement the commenting UI
- implement relationships and sharing
- recruit some beta testers

done:
+ order local server
+ should be possible to init a new VM instance with a few commands
