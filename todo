- first thing is to get all the parts working locally (api calling over sockets not exposed to the internet), along with the roughest possible web front end.
  - make sure to write a manifest of how you setup the venv 
  - should be possible to init a new VM instance with a few commands

- finish API 
- finish test harness
- rework authentication to not suck so horribly
- need to be able to change passwords & personal details

- order local server


- then we get a cheap SSL key
- then we bang on the UI for signing up and authentication
- improve the browsing UI
- implement the commenting UI
- implement relationships and sharing
- recruit some beta testers
